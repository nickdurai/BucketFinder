# BucketFinder
Program that identifies when a basketball is scored based on the input video

# Uses
I made this program to help me find when baskets are scored in my own clips, as I'm a videographer and usually have to go through many clips to find when scores happen for editing mixtapes/reels
Can also be used by trainers/basketball players to analyze a player/teams playstyle or game
